# PDS Project - Best collaborative editor ever

This project is a school assignment, related to the best course ever: Programmazione di Sistema.

The aim of the project is to spaccarti il culo for 9 fucking points over 31, seems legit. It consists in building a working collaborative editor, if you know what it is... Using state of the art (or whatever) C++ and Qt tools. 

For any problems we asked Rick of Rick and Morty, because he is the Rickest of the Rick, he is the smartest man in the Universe and, you know, it turned himself into a pickle once... PICKLE-RICK!!!!
